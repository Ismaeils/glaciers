# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

All you need to run this is

* Set MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to whatever you'd like both in the web service and db service

* docker-compose up


Things to consider

* The DB is stateless, if the whole stack is restarted, all stored data will be gone
